  <h1> RandDOS Hosting</h1>
  <p> This site is still in early alpha</p>
  <h2> Getting started</h2>
  <p>We wanted to design RandDOS so it is as flexible as possible and when others host it that it wouldnt take hours to properly configure. Thats why the html document has been specially modified so it could run off one singular html file and nothing else! Essentially everyone can host a RandDOS instance just using a html file and not all of it. There will be a site made for RandDOS instances so all of the ones made will be shown (you will have to complete a form for yours to be acknowledged!)</p>
  <h2>Downloading and setup</h2>
  <p>You can download the zip <a href="https://github.com/therandomspoon/RandDOS-Hosting/edit/main/RandDOS hosting.zip" download>here</a></p>

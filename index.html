  <h1> RandDOS Hosting</h1>
  <p> This site is still in early alpha</p>
  <h2> Getting started</h2>
  <p>We wanted to design RandDOS so it is as flexible as possible and when others host it that it wouldnt take hours to properly configure. Thats why the html document has been specially modified so it could run off one singular html file and nothing else! Essentially everyone can host a RandDOS instance just using a html file and not all of it. There will be a site made for RandDOS instances so all of the ones made will be shown (you will have to complete a form for yours to be acknowledged!)</p>
  <h2>Downloading and setup</h2>
  <p>You can download the zip <a href="https://therandomspoon.github.io/RandDOS-Hosting//RandDOS hosting.zip" download>here</a></p>
  <p> From here use whatever domain and service provider you want and simply use the html file and it should all work. Any problems please upload it to the RandDOS issues area and the discussion section is also available</p>
  <h2>Getting my instance acknowledged by the instance site</h2>
  <p>Simply complete the form <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/KAtnMhJpgf">here</a></p>
  <p>The zip contains all of the css and js locally so you can customise your own site</p>
